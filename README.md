# non-COVID-19-ICU-patients
This GitHub webpage makes available the data and the codes (Stata format) to replicate the results of the manuscript entitled "Big Data evidence of the impact of COVID-19 hospitalizations on mortality rates of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients", by Bruno Wichmann (University of Alberta) & Roberta Moreira Wichmann (World Bank, Brazil & Brazilian Institute of Education, Development and Research â€“ IDP, Economics Graduate Program).

The Stata code requires four packages:

-ASDOC (https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458466.html)

-ESTOUT (https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s439301.html)

-REGHDFE (https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457874.html)

-PARTPRED (https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457176.html).

These packages can be installed using the "ssc install" command (refer to Stata help for details). The code will generate several files, including 'Model_results.dta' (used to make Figure 1) and 'N_Patients.dta' (used to make Figure 2).
