# non-COVID-19-ICU-patients
# This GitHub webpage makes available the data and the codes (Stata format) to replicate the results of the manuscript entitled "The impact of COVID-19 hospitalizations on mortality rates of non-COVID-19 critically ill patients: big data evidence from Brazil", by Bruno Wichmann (University of Alberta) & Roberta Moreira Wichmann (World Bank, Brazil & Brazilian Institute of Education, Development and Research â€“ IDP, Economics Graduate Program).

The Stata code requires two packages, ASDOC (https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s458466.html) and REGHDFE (https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457874.html) that can be install using the "ssc install" command (refer to Stata help).
